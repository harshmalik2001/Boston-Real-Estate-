## Boston Real Estate Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression
This project uses Random Forest Regression to predict the prices of real estate in Boston. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, which is a commonly used dataset in machine learning.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
## Usage
To use this project, simply open the Boston_Project(1).ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

The notebook consists of the following sections:

Loading the dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
Training the Random Forest Regression model
Evaluating the model
Visualizing the results
## Results
The Random Forest Regression model was able to achieve an R-squared score of 0.88 on the test set, indicating that it is a good fit for the data. The feature importance plot shows that the most important features for predicting real estate prices in Boston are the number of rooms (RM), the percentage of lower status of the population (LSTAT).
